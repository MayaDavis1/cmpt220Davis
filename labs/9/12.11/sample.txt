Fur scre and seven years ag ur fathers brught frth n this cntinent a new natin, cnceived in liberty and dedicated t the prpsitin that all men are created equal. Nw we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that natin r any natin s cnceived and s dedicated can lng endure. We are met n a great battlefield f that war. We have cme t dedicate a prtin f that field as a final resting-place fr thse wh here gave their lives that that natin might live. It is altgether fitting and prper that we shuld d this. But in a larger sense, we cannt dedicate, we cannt cnsecrate, we cannt hallw this grund. The brave men, living and dead wh struggled here have cnsecrated it far abve ur pr pwer t add r detract. The wrld will little nte nr lng remember what we say here, but it can never frget what they did here. It is fr us the living rather t be dedicated here t the unfinished wrk which they wh fught here have thus far s nbly advanced. It is rather fr us t be here dedicated t the great task remaining befre us--that frm these hnred dead we take increased devtin t that cause fr which they gave the last full measure f devtin--that we here highly reslve that these dead shall nt have died in vain, that this natin under Gd shall have a new birth f freedm, and that gvernment f the ple, by the ple, fr the ple shall nt perish frm the earth.
